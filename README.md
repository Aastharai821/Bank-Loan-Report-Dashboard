## Project Overview  
This capstone project, developed as part of an Excel-focused upskilling program, explores loan performance metrics through a dynamic, interactive dashboard. Using a sample lending dataset, the dashboard supports decision-making on risk assessment, customer behavior, and lending trends.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Cleaned and validated 10K+ loan records using Power Query; applied data validation rules to ensure input consistency and structure.

- **KPI Tracking & MoM Trend Analysis:**  
  Designed dashboards to track:  
  - Total Loan Applications (including MTD & MoM tracking)  
  - Funded Amount and Amount Received  
  - Average Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio  
  - Good vs. Bad Loan Classifications based on loan status  

- **Risk Segmentation:**  
  Implemented logic to classify loans as **"Good"** (Fully Paid, Current) and **"Bad"** (Charged Off), with percentage and funding breakdowns for each category.

- **Dynamic Filtering & Interactivity:**  
  Used Pivot Tables, slicers, and conditional formatting to enable flexible filtering by:  
  - Loan Purpose  
  - Home Ownership Status  
  - Employment Length  
  - State  

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Built interactive charts including:  
  - **Line Charts** for monthly lending trends  
  - **Filled Maps** for regional analysis  
  - **Donut/Bar Charts** for loan term, purpose, and borrower segmentation

## Business Value & Insights

- Identified loan default patterns across different terms and employment categories  
- Enabled month-over-month comparison of lending trends, repayments, and interest rates  
- Provided segmentation for high-risk borrowers to inform credit strategy  
- Saved an estimated **~5 hours/week** by automating repetitive reporting processes

## Outcome  
The final Excel dashboard offers an intuitive, interactive solution for tracking loan performance, supporting insights into credit risk, regulatory compliance, customer behavior, and strategic planning for bank loan operations.
